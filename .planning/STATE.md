## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Scrape-first approach — pre-seed 200+ entries before any public URL is shared
- Roadmap: MCP-only for Phase 4 — ACP/A2A deferred (protocol in flux, merger unconfirmed)
- Roadmap: Telegram bot deferred to v2 — focus web + MCP for v1
- Roadmap: Phases 3, 4, 5 can execute in parallel after Phase 2 completes

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: GitHub PAT and HF_TOKEN required before scraping workers can run — Jet must provision
- Phase 4: Decision needed on MCP deployment target (Vercel stateless vs. Fly.io Bun process) before Phase 4 planning
- General: Vercel Hobby plan is non-commercial — if any monetization is added, upgrade to Pro ($20/mo) required
