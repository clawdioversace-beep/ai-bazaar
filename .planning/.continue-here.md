<current_state>
AI Bazaar v1.0 is LIVE on Vercel. All 6 milestone phases shipped. Production deployment completed this session with several build fixes along the way.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- v1.0 milestone archived (all 6 phases, 16 plans, 6,103 LOC)
- Git tag v1.0 created and pushed
- GitHub repo created: https://github.com/clawdioversace-beep/ai-bazaar
- Code pushed to master branch
- Turso CLI installed, Jet authenticated and created production DB
- Production Turso DB: libsql://ai-bazaar-clawdio.aws-ap-northeast-1.turso.io
- Migrations run against production (custom single-statement runner for remote Turso)
- 3,259 listings imported from local dev.db to production
- Timestamps fixed (ISO strings -> Unix epoch seconds)
- 3 starter packs seeded (23 tool links)
- FTS5 index rebuilt on production
- Vercel env vars set (TURSO_DATABASE_URL, TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN)
- 3 production deploys to fix build issues:
  1. favicon.ico moved from src/app/ to public/ (Next.js 16 route handler bug)
  2. force-dynamic added to all DB-fetching pages (prevent build-time prerendering)
  3. JSON feed date_published fixed (integer timestamp -> Date -> ISO string)
- Site live at: https://ai-bazaar-eight.vercel.app
- All pages verified: homepage (200), /tools (200), /packs (200), /submit (200), /api/feed (200)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Custom domain setup (aibazaar.dev or similar) — needs Jet to purchase domain
- GitHub-Vercel integration failed (permissions mismatch between jpippos-projects Vercel org and clawdioversace-beep GitHub) — currently deploying via `vercel deploy --prod` CLI
- CI/CD pipeline not yet set up (GitHub Actions -> Vercel)
- API tokens for scrapers not yet provisioned (GitHub PAT, HF_TOKEN) — scrapers can't re-run
- "New This Week" section shows HuggingFace hashes (all entries got same createdAt during bulk import)
- Phase 6 Plan 03 (admin UI for pack editing) — deferred from v1.0
- Production seed script creates duplicates on re-run — needs upsert logic
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Used `vercel deploy --prod` CLI instead of GitHub integration (integration failed, CLI works fine)
- Rewrote migrate.ts to detect remote Turso and execute statements individually (Turso HTTP rejects multi-statement batches)
- Exported local dev.db data as JSON and imported via batch inserts instead of re-running scrapers (scrapers need API tokens Jet hasn't provisioned)
- Used `printf` instead of `echo` for Vercel env vars (echo adds trailing newline which corrupts URLs)
- All DB-fetching pages marked `force-dynamic` to prevent Next.js build-time prerendering
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- GitHub-Vercel integration: needs Vercel admin to authorize the GitHub repo connection (likely a Vercel org permissions issue)
- Scraper API tokens: Jet needs to create GitHub PAT and HuggingFace token, add to .env
- Custom domain: Jet needs to purchase and configure DNS
</blockers>

<context>
v1.0 MVP is fully deployed and working. The immediate next steps depend on Jet's priority:
1. If he wants to improve the site → new milestone with /gsd:new-milestone
2. If he wants to fix the data quality (HuggingFace hashes in "New This Week") → provision GitHub PAT + HF_TOKEN and re-run scrapers
3. If he wants a custom domain → purchase domain, configure in Vercel dashboard
The Vercel deployment URL (ai-bazaar-eight.vercel.app) is functional but not branded.

Start with: Ask Jet what's next — new AI Bazaar milestone, or switch to a different project. If continuing AI Bazaar, run `/gsd:new-milestone` to define v1.1 scope.
