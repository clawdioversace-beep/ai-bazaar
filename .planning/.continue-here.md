### This Session (2026-02-21)

- **Visual repositioning — directory → learning hub** (commit a4c6ba5)
  - Fixed Geist font override (was loaded but Arial overrode it)
  - Added indigo/amber brand color system replacing generic blue/zinc accents
  - Redesigned homepage hero with builder-focused copy and amber pill badge
  - Elevated Starter Packs with violet-tinted editorial section
  - Elevated Reads as "Learn" section with amber-tinted background
  - Reordered homepage: Hero → Packs → Learn → Hot → New → Categories
  - Simplified ListingCard: removed runtime/chain/download metadata
  - Updated nav language: Browse→Explore, Reads→Learn, Submit→Share a Tool
  - Added multi-column footer with newsletter signup and quick links
  - Added mobile hamburger nav with slide-down menu
  - Applied rounded-xl cards with smooth hover transitions across all components
  - 13 files modified (11 existing + 2 new components)

### Previous Sessions

<remaining_work>

### From Milestone 1 Gaps (still open)
- Task 3 gap: Admin approve page for pending submissions (~1 hour)
- Task 6: Affiliate link infrastructure (~2 hours)
- Curation quality: Jet noted homepage shows generic infra repos, needs better algorithm or manual picks

### Future Phases
- Newsletter content production (requires editorial workflow)
- New Starter Packs creation (requires curation decisions from Jet)
- Monetization implementation (featured placements, sponsor slots)
- SEO/meta updates across all pages
- Re-embed Pinecone after any major scraper runs (bun run embed:listings:prod)

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Extracted footer as client component (SubscribeForm import) — keeps layout.tsx as server component
- Extracted mobile nav as client component — hamburger toggle, no sidebar/drawer
- Removed runtime/chain/download metadata from ListingCard — value prop (tagline + category) more important on cards
- Removed SubscribeForm from hero — newsletter now in footer + scroll banner only
- Used ring-1 instead of border for pack cards in tinted section

</decisions_made>

None. Session complete.

<context>
Repositioning is frontend-only. Same backend, DB, API. Strategic goal: stop competing with Toolify/TAAFT on catalog size, own the "opinionated builder's guide" position in AI/MCP/Web3 intersection. Visual changes make the site feel curated and editorial.

Start with: Address remaining Milestone 1 gaps (admin page, affiliate links, curation quality) or /gsd:check-todos for next priority.
