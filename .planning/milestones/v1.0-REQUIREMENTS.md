# Requirements: AI Bazaar

**Defined:** 2026-02-18
**Core Value:** Any agent or human can find the right AI/Web3 tool for their need in under 60 seconds — agents via MCP protocol query, humans via search or curated bundle.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Catalog Foundation

- [ ] **CAT-01**: Listing data model stores structured metadata: name, tagline, description, category, tags, source URL, docs URL, license, runtime, chain support, MCP/ACP compatibility flags
- [ ] **CAT-02**: Full-text search across listing name, tagline, description, and tags using SQLite FTS5
- [ ] **CAT-03**: Canonical tag taxonomy with normalization (e.g. "mcp", "MCP", "mcp-server" all resolve to same tag)
- [ ] **CAT-04**: Category browsing with hierarchical categories (mcp-server, ai-agent, web3-tool, defi-tool, infra, framework)
- [ ] **CAT-05**: Listing detail page at `/tools/[slug]` with all metadata, source links, and external metrics (stars, downloads)
- [ ] **CAT-06**: `last_verified_at` timestamp on every listing to track freshness
- [ ] **CAT-07**: Dead-link detection via scheduled HEAD requests, auto-flagging stale entries

### Scraping & Data Pipeline

- [ ] **SCRP-01**: GitHub API scraper targeting topics: mcp-server, ai-agent, web3, model-context-protocol — using authenticated REST/GraphQL API
- [ ] **SCRP-02**: npm registry scraper for packages tagged with mcp, ai-agent, web3, agent-framework keywords
- [ ] **SCRP-03**: HuggingFace Hub API scraper for models/spaces tagged with agent, web3, mcp keywords
- [ ] **SCRP-04**: Source-specific normalizer transforms raw scrape data to CatalogEntry schema via Zod validation
- [ ] **SCRP-05**: CatalogService.upsert() deduplicates entries by source URL, updating existing entries on re-scrape
- [ ] **SCRP-06**: Pre-seed catalog with 200+ entries across 5+ categories before any public URL is shared
- [ ] **SCRP-07**: Scheduled re-indexing cron job with per-source rate limiting and exponential backoff

### Web Interface

- [ ] **WEB-01**: Homepage with featured/new listings and category navigation
- [ ] **WEB-02**: Browse page with multi-select filters: category, chain, protocol, runtime
- [ ] **WEB-03**: Sort by recency and popularity (stars + downloads as proxy)
- [ ] **WEB-04**: Mobile-responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- [ ] **WEB-05**: Shareable listing URLs with clean slugs (`/tools/[slug]`)
- [ ] **WEB-06**: Cursor-based pagination on browse/search results
- [ ] **WEB-07**: "New this week" section on homepage driven by ingest timestamp
- [ ] **WEB-08**: SEO-optimized listing pages with unique cross-platform value (not just mirrored source data)

### MCP Protocol Endpoint

- [ ] **MCP-01**: MCP server exposed via Streamable HTTP transport at `/api/mcp` using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- [ ] **MCP-02**: `search_catalog` tool: agents can search by keyword, category, protocol compatibility, chain support
- [ ] **MCP-03**: `get_listing` tool: agents can fetch full listing details by slug or ID
- [ ] **MCP-04**: `submit_listing` tool: agents can submit new listings programmatically
- [ ] **MCP-05**: Machine-readable catalog schema exposed as MCP resource
- [ ] **MCP-06**: Cursor-based pagination on search results matching MCP registry spec patterns

### Submission & Community

- [ ] **SUB-01**: Permissionless web submission form: URL + optional metadata fields, auto-enrichment via scrape
- [ ] **SUB-02**: Submission validation: Zod schema check + deduplication against existing source URLs
- [ ] **SUB-03**: Basic upvote per listing (anonymous, no auth required)
- [ ] **SUB-04**: JSON feed of new listings for power users and agent crawlers

### Starter Packs

- [ ] **PACK-01**: 3-5 curated starter pack bundles (e.g. "DeFi Dev Starter", "AI Agent Toolbox", "Solana Builder Kit")
- [ ] **PACK-02**: Each pack has title, description, and 5-10 linked tool listings with narrative context
- [ ] **PACK-03**: Starter pack browse page at `/packs`
- [ ] **PACK-04**: Individual pack detail page at `/packs/[slug]`

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Telegram Bot

- **TG-01**: Telegram bot for conversational catalog discovery via natural language
- **TG-02**: Search and browse commands with 3-5 results per query
- **TG-03**: Inline query handler for quick search from any Telegram chat
- **TG-04**: Starter pack recommendations via bot

### User Accounts & Curation

- **USER-01**: User accounts with authenticated submissions
- **USER-02**: User-curated lists ("Top 10 MCP servers for X")
- **USER-03**: Submission attribution tied to accounts

### Advanced Search

- **SRCH-01**: Semantic / embedding-based search for natural language queries
- **SRCH-02**: Composite quality "Bazaar score" (GitHub stars + npm downloads + upvotes weighted formula)

### Web3 Features

- **W3-01**: On-chain metadata verification (contract address validation via chain explorers)
- **W3-02**: Wallet connection for claiming project listings
- **W3-03**: Verified publisher badges

### Agent Protocol

- **A2A-01**: A2A (formerly ACP) agent discovery layer for agent-to-agent delegation

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Instagram presence | Deferred past v1 — focus web + MCP first |
| Building/hosting own tools | Pure aggregator model — only curated third-party tools |
| Monetization / paid features | Build traffic and catalog first, monetize later |
| Mobile app | Web-first, mobile via responsive design |
| User accounts / auth for browsing | Frictionless anonymous access — auth only when spam/gaming becomes a problem |
| Full review/comment system | Requires moderation; spam magnet; simple upvote sufficient for v1 |
| Real-time price feeds / TVL | DeFi Llama does this better — link to them instead |
| In-app agent execution / sandboxing | Massive security/infra scope — link to tool's own demo instead |
| Wallet-gating for any feature | Kills adoption for non-crypto audience — wallet always optional |
| Manual curation of every listing | Doesn't scale; bottleneck; algorithmic quality signals + upvotes instead |
