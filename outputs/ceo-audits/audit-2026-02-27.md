# CEO Daily Portfolio Audit — 2026-02-27
**Lens:** Monetization/Business

**Scope:** All GitHub repos

## 1. Add "Featured" Sponsor Slot to Tool Detail Pages — ai-bazaar
**What:** Add a visually distinct "Featured Tool" banner/card at the top of category browse pages and a subtle "Sponsored" badge slot on individual tool pages. Wire up a static config (`src/config/sponsors.ts`) that maps sponsor slugs to their listings — no backend needed yet, just the UI scaffolding so you can sell the first placement manually and flip the switch.
**Why:** This creates a tangible product to sell to tool vendors today — n8n, Dify, and LobeHub all have commercial interest in visibility; a $500/month featured slot on a trending tool page is a realistic first revenue conversation.
**Files:** `src/config/sponsors.ts` (new), `src/app/browse/page.tsx`, `src/app/tools/[slug]/page.tsx`, a new `src/components/sponsored-badge.tsx`
**Effort:** 2 hours

## 2. Add a "Built With" / Affiliate Footer to All Claude Skill READMEs — skill-vault / crowdsourced-op-skills
**What:** Add a standardized footer block to every skill README in both repos that links back to AI Bazaar with a UTM parameter (`?ref=skill-vault`), and includes one affiliate-eligible tool recommendation relevant to that skill's use case (e.g., the `vercel:deploy` skill links to Vercel's referral program).
**Why:** These public repos get organic GitHub traffic from Claude users — turning them into soft funnels for AI Bazaar and affiliate clicks costs nothing to set up and compounds as the repos grow in stars.
**Files:** All `SKILL.md` / `README.md` files in `skill-vault/` and `crowdsourced-op-skills/`, plus a shared footer template snippet
**Effort:** 1.5–2 hours

## 3. Wire "Hype Score" as a Visible Ranking Signal with CTA — ai-bazaar
**What:** On the homepage and browse pages, surface the hype score as a visible badge (e.g., "🔥 55 Hype") next to each tool card with a tooltip explaining it's based on recent GitHub momentum. Add a small "How is this ranked?" link that opens a modal explaining the scoring — this doubles as SEO copy and trust-building for potential sponsors who want to understand placement value.
**Why:** Making the ranking methodology transparent increases credibility with both users and potential paying advertisers — a sponsor buying a "Featured" slot wants to know the audience is real and the ranking is meaningful, not arbitrary.
**Files:** `src/components/tool-card.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/browse/page.tsx`, a new `src/components/hype-score-tooltip.tsx`
**Effort:** 2 hours
