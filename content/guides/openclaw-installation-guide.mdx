## What Is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is a local AI agent framework that runs on your machine. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude's web interface where you talk to a generic AI, OpenClaw lets you create an agent with:

- **A personality** — you define who the agent is, how it behaves, what it cares about
- **Persistent memory** — it remembers conversations across sessions
- **Tools and skills** — it can search the web, run code, manage files, and more
- **Channel access** — talk to it via Telegram, Discord, or a local web interface
- **Scheduled tasks** — it can wake up on its own, check things, and alert you

Think of it as the difference between renting an apartment (ChatGPT) and owning a house (OpenClaw). You control everything.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:

- **macOS or Linux** (Windows works via WSL)
- **Node.js 18+** — check with `node -v`
- **npm or bun** — comes with Node.js or install bun from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh)
- **A Telegram account** — for the easiest way to chat with your agent
- **A model provider API key** — Moonshot/Kimi offers a free tier (see our [model selection guide](/guides/openclaw-model-selection))

---

## Step 1: Install OpenClaw

Install OpenClaw globally:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
openclaw --version
```

You should see a version number. If you get "command not found", try closing and reopening your terminal.

---

## Step 2: Initial Setup

Run the setup wizard:

```bash
openclaw setup
```

This creates the `~/.openclaw/` directory and walks you through initial configuration:

1. **Gateway port** — defaults to `18789`. Press Enter to accept unless you have a conflict.
2. **Model provider** — choose your LLM provider. Moonshot/Kimi is recommended for beginners (free tier available).
3. **API key** — paste your provider's API key when prompted.

After setup, your directory structure looks like:

```
~/.openclaw/
├── openclaw.json          # Main configuration
├── workspace/             # Your agent's personality files
├── agents/                # Agent configurations
├── identity/              # Device authentication
└── logs/                  # Operation logs
```

---

## Step 3: First Boot — Meet Your Agent

Start the OpenClaw gateway:

```bash
openclaw gateway
```

On first boot, OpenClaw reads the `BOOTSTRAP.md` file in your workspace. This is a first-run conversation that helps you set up your agent's personality:

- **Name your agent** — give it a name (e.g., "Atlas", "Nova", "Clawdio")
- **Define its vibe** — professional? casual? sarcastic? enthusiastic?
- **Set boundaries** — what should it help with? what should it refuse?

The agent will write its own `IDENTITY.md` and `SOUL.md` based on your answers. After this first conversation, `BOOTSTRAP.md` is no longer needed.

---

## Step 4: Connect Telegram

The fastest way to interact with your agent is via Telegram.

### Create a Telegram bot

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a name (e.g., "My AI Agent")
4. Choose a username (must end in `bot`, e.g., `myai_agent_bot`)
5. BotFather gives you a token like: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxYZ`

### Add the token to OpenClaw

```bash
openclaw channels telegram setup
```

Paste your bot token when prompted. OpenClaw will configure the Telegram channel.

### Set up security

OpenClaw uses an allowlist to control who can talk to your bot:

```bash
openclaw channels telegram allow <your-telegram-user-id>
```

To find your Telegram user ID, search for `@userinfobot` on Telegram and send `/start`.

### Start chatting

1. Open Telegram
2. Search for your bot by its username
3. Send any message
4. Your agent responds

---

## Step 5: Verify It Works

Run a quick health check:

```bash
openclaw status
```

You should see:
- Gateway: running on port 18789
- Agent: main (active)
- Channels: telegram (connected)
- Model: your configured model

Try these interactions with your agent via Telegram:
- Send "Hello, who are you?" — it should respond with its personality
- Send "What can you do?" — it should describe its capabilities
- Send "Remember that my favorite color is blue" — then in a new session, ask "What's my favorite color?" to test memory

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Port 18789 already in use"

Another process is using that port. Either:

```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -i :18789
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change the port in openclaw.json
# Edit gateway.port to a different number (e.g., 18790)
```

### "API key invalid" or model errors

1. Double-check your API key in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`
2. Verify the key works by testing the provider's API directly
3. Check if you've exceeded the free tier limits

### Telegram bot not responding

1. Make sure the gateway is running (`openclaw gateway`)
2. Check that your Telegram user ID is in the allowlist
3. Look at the logs: `~/.openclaw/logs/` for error messages
4. Try restarting: `openclaw gateway` (stop and start again)

### "Module not found" errors

```bash
# Reinstall OpenClaw
npm install -g openclaw

# Or if using bun
bun install -g openclaw
```

## What's in Your Workspace

After setup, your `~/.openclaw/workspace/` directory contains the files that define your agent. These are all editable markdown files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `IDENTITY.md` | Agent's name, personality, emoji |
| `SOUL.md` | Core philosophy and behavior rules |
| `USER.md` | Information about you (auto-updated) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Workspace-level instructions |
| `MEMORY.md` | Curated long-term memory |
| `TOOLS.md` | Local environment notes |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Periodic check-in configuration |

Learn more about each file in our [.md Files Explained](/guides/openclaw-md-files-explained) guide.

## Next Steps

Now that your agent is running:

1. **Customize its personality** — edit `IDENTITY.md` and `SOUL.md`
2. **Choose the right model** — read our [Model Selection guide](/guides/openclaw-model-selection)
3. **Add capabilities** — install skills and plugins ([Skills guide](/guides/openclaw-skills-and-plugins))
4. **Learn the config files** — understand what each [.md file does](/guides/openclaw-md-files-explained)

> Your agent is alive. Now make it yours.
