## What Is ElevenLabs?

[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) is an AI audio platform that turns text into lifelike speech, clones voices, generates music and sound effects, and powers real-time conversational voice agents. If you're building anything that needs to talk, listen, or process audio — this is the platform to know.

The platform is organized into three product families:

- **ElevenCreative** — Studio tools for content creators (TTS, dubbing, voice design)
- **ElevenAgents** — Build and deploy real-time conversational voice AI agents
- **ElevenAPI** — Developer APIs for integrating all of the above into your own apps

## What Can You Build?

| Capability | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Text-to-Speech** | Convert text to natural audio with emotional expression in 70+ languages |
| **Voice Cloning** | Clone any voice from audio samples (instant or professional-grade) |
| **Voice Agents** | Deploy real-time conversational AI with sub-75ms latency |
| **Speech-to-Text** | Transcribe audio with Scribe v2 (90+ languages) |
| **Text-to-Dialogue** | Generate multi-speaker conversations from a script |
| **Music Generation** | Create compositions, stems, and loops from text prompts |
| **Sound Effects** | Generate cinematic SFX from descriptions |
| **Dubbing** | Translate audio/video into other languages, preserving speaker identity |

---

## AI Models — Which One to Use

| Model | Best For | Languages |
|---|---|---|
| **Eleven v3** | Highest quality — audiobooks, podcasts, long-form | 70+ |
| **Flash v2.5** | Real-time agents, chatbots (75ms latency) | 32 |
| **Multilingual v2** | Video voiceovers, dubbing, production content | 29 |
| **Turbo v2.5** | Prototyping, quick demos | 32 |
| **Scribe v2** | Transcription (batch) | 90+ |
| **Scribe v2 Realtime** | Live captioning | 90+ |

**Rule of thumb:** Use Flash for anything real-time. Use v3 or Multilingual v2 for pre-rendered content. Use Turbo for throwaway prototypes.

## Pricing

| Plan | Price/mo | Credits | What You Unlock |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | $0 | 10,000 chars | 3 custom voices, non-commercial only |
| **Starter** | $5 | 30,000 chars | Commercial rights, Instant Voice Cloning |
| **Creator** | $22 | 100,000 chars | Professional Voice Cloning |
| **Pro** | $99 | 500,000 chars | Higher concurrency, priority queue |
| **Scale** | $330 | 2M chars | Enterprise features |
| **Business** | $1,320 | 11M credits | Custom SLAs, dedicated support |

Annual billing saves ~17%. Flash/Turbo models cost fewer credits per character than standard models.

The free tier is enough to prototype and test. You'll hit Starter territory once you're generating audio for production use.

## Getting Started (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. Sign up at [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io)
2. Go to **Profile Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Generate a key and store it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

### Step 2: Install the SDK

**JavaScript / TypeScript:**
```bash
npm install @elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js
```

**Python:**
```bash
pip install elevenlabs
```

### Step 3: Generate Your First Audio

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
import { ElevenLabsClient } from "@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js";

const client = new ElevenLabsClient();

const audio = await client.textToSpeech.convert("JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb", {
  text: "Welcome to AI Bazaar. Discover the best AI tools in under 60 seconds.",
  modelId: "eleven_multilingual_v2",
  outputFormat: "mp3_44100_128",
});
```

**Python:**
```python
from elevenlabs import ElevenLabs

client = ElevenLabs()

audio = client.text_to_speech.convert(
    voice_id="JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",
    text="Welcome to AI Bazaar. Discover the best AI tools in under 60 seconds.",
    model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",
    output_format="mp3_44100_128"
)
```

That's it. `JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb` is "George," one of the default voices. You'll get back a binary audio stream you can save to a file or stream directly.

## Raw API (No SDK)

If you prefer raw HTTP:

```
POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}
```

**Headers:**
```
Content-Type: application/json
xi-api-key: your_api_key
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "text": "Your text here",
  "model_id": "eleven_multilingual_v2",
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.5,
    "similarity_boost": 0.75,
    "speed": 1.0
  }
}
```

**Response:** Binary audio stream (`application/octet-stream`).

**Output format options:** `mp3_44100_128`, `mp3_22050_32`, `pcm_16000`, `pcm_22050`, `pcm_24000`, `pcm_44100`, `ulaw_8000`

## Voice Cloning

### Instant Voice Cloning

- **Plan required:** Starter ($5/mo) or above
- **Audio needed:** 1-2 minutes of clean audio (no reverb, no background noise)
- **Speed:** Near-instant
- **Best for:** Quick experiments, prototyping, short-term use

Keep recordings under 3 minutes — more audio doesn't improve quality and can actually hurt it.

### Professional Voice Cloning

- **Plan required:** Creator ($22/mo) or above
- **Audio needed:** Minimum 30 minutes, optimal 2-3 hours
- **Speed:** Requires processing time
- **Best for:** Production use, long-form content, brand voices

Both are available via API or the dashboard UI.

## Conversational Voice Agents

ElevenAgents lets you build voice agents that handle real-time phone calls and conversations. The system chains four components:

1. **Speech-to-Text** — Transcribes what the user says
2. **Language Model** — Your choice of LLM (or bring your own)
3. **Text-to-Speech** — Low-latency voice output from 5,000+ voices
4. **Turn-taking model** — Handles natural conversation timing (interruptions, pauses, backchannels)

### What People Build With It

- Customer support phone lines that never sleep
- Sales qualification bots that sound human
- Virtual receptionists and booking assistants
- Interactive tutorials and onboarding flows

### Where You Can Deploy

- **Web** — Embed in any website with the JS SDK
- **Mobile** — Native SDKs for Swift, Kotlin, Flutter
- **Telephony** — Connect to phone systems for inbound/outbound calls
- **Dashboard** — Visual workflow builder if you don't want to code

You can have a working voice agent in about 5 minutes using the [ElevenAgents dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai).
