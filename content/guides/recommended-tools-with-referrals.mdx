## How This Page Works

Transparency first: some links on this page earn AI Bazaar a small commission when you sign up. We only list tools we genuinely use and recommend. If a tool doesn't have a referral program, we still recommend it — we just don't earn anything.

Our credibility matters more than any commission. Every tool here is one we'd recommend even without affiliate links.

## Deployment & Hosting

### Vercel
**Free tier | Pro from $20/mo**

The fastest path from code to live URL. One-click deploys for Next.js, React, and static sites. AI Bazaar itself runs on Vercel. Their free tier is genuinely generous — custom domains, HTTPS, edge functions included.

**What's in it for you:** Instant deploys with git push. No DevOps knowledge needed.

### Railway
**Free $5 credit/mo | Pro $5/mo**

Deploy anything — backends, bots, databases, cron jobs. Less opinionated than Vercel. Great for full-stack apps that need more than just a frontend.

**What's in it for you:** New accounts get $20 in Railway credits — essentially a free month of hosting.

---

## AI Assistants

### Claude Pro (Anthropic)
**$20/mo**

The AI we build with daily. Claude Opus is the most capable coding model available. Claude Code (the terminal tool) is unmatched for full-stack development. If you're serious about AI-assisted coding, this is the subscription to get.

**What's in it for you:** Access to Opus, 5x more usage than free, priority access.

---

## Code Editors

### Windsurf
**Free tier (generous) | Pro $15/mo**

AI-native editor with a unique "Cascade" feature for multi-step edits. More generous free tier than most competitors. Good for builders who want AI in their editor without paying $20/mo.

**What's in it for you:** 250 premium credits when you sign up through our link.

## Tools We Recommend (No Referral)

These tools don't have affiliate programs, but we recommend them just as strongly:

### Cursor — AI Code Editor
**Free tier | Pro $20/mo** | [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)

The most popular AI code editor. If you're choosing between Cursor and Windsurf, try both free tiers and pick whichever clicks. Both are excellent.

### Turso — Database
**Free tier (500 DBs)** | [turso.tech](https://turso.tech)

SQLite at the edge. The most generous free tier of any database. AI Bazaar uses Turso. Zero reason not to use it for new projects.

### Supabase — Database + Auth
**Free tier** | [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

PostgreSQL + authentication + real-time + storage in one platform. More features than Turso, more complexity too. Great when you need auth built in.

### Bruno — API Testing
**Free and open source** | [usebruno.com](https://usebruno.com)

API client that stores requests as files. Git-friendly, no account needed. The privacy-respecting alternative to Postman.

### Obsidian — Notes
**Free** | [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)

Markdown notes stored as local files. No lock-in, git-compatible. The best note-taking tool for developers.

### Perplexity — AI Search
**Free tier | Pro $20/mo** | [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai)

AI search that cites sources. Better than Google for research questions. Their affiliate program is currently paused but the tool is excellent regardless.

### iTerm2 — Terminal (macOS)
**Free** | [iterm2.com](https://iterm2.com)

The terminal upgrade every Mac developer eventually installs. Split panes, search, hotkey window.

### Warp — AI Terminal
**Free tier** | [warp.dev](https://warp.dev)

Modern terminal with AI built in. Great for beginners who find the terminal intimidating.

---

## Web3 Infrastructure

### Helius — Solana RPC
**Free tier** | [helius.dev](https://helius.dev)

The fastest Solana RPC provider. Generous free tier for developers. Essential for any Solana project.

### Alchemy — Multi-chain
**Free tier** | [alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com)

Multi-chain Web3 infrastructure. Supports Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and more. Their startup program offers credits for qualifying projects.

## How We Choose What to List

Every tool on this page passes three tests:

1. **We use it ourselves.** AI Bazaar is built with Vercel, Turso, Claude, and Cursor. The Telegram bridge runs on Railway. We're not recommending things we've never touched.

2. **It solves a real problem.** Each tool fills a specific gap in the AI builder's workflow. No fluff.

3. **It has a viable free tier.** We don't recommend tools that require payment to even try. Every tool here lets you start for free and upgrade when you need to.

Referral programs don't influence our recommendations. They just help keep AI Bazaar running while we curate the best tools for builders.
