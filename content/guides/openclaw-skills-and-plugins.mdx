## Skills vs Plugins

OpenClaw has two extension mechanisms. They sound similar but serve different purposes:

**Skills** are capabilities your agent can use during conversations. Think of them as "apps" for your agent — web search, code execution, file management, email sending.

**Plugins** are extensions to the OpenClaw gateway itself. They add infrastructure-level features that work across all conversations — like persistent memory, analytics, or new communication channels.

| | Skills | Plugins |
|---|--------|---------|
| **Scope** | Per-conversation | System-wide |
| **What they add** | Tools the agent can use | Gateway features |
| **Example** | Web search, browser, calculator | Memory system, observation feed |
| **Configuration** | In skill files | In openclaw.json |
| **Installed at** | Varies | `~/.openclaw/extensions/` |

## Installing Skills

Skills can come bundled with OpenClaw, installed from packages, or created custom.

### Using the CLI

```bash
# List available skills
openclaw skills list

# Install a skill
openclaw skills install <skill-name>

# Enable/disable a skill
openclaw skills enable <skill-name>
openclaw skills disable <skill-name>
```

### Manual installation

Skills follow a standard structure:

```
skills/
├── web-search/
│   ├── skill.json          # Skill manifest (name, description, tools)
│   ├── index.ts            # Implementation
│   └── README.md           # Documentation
```

The `skill.json` defines what tools the skill exposes:

```json
{
  "name": "web-search",
  "description": "Search the web using Brave Search API",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "search_web",
      "description": "Search the web for a given query",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "query": { "type": "string", "description": "Search query" }
        },
        "required": ["query"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Essential Skills to Start With

### Web Search

Lets your agent search the internet for current information.

**Why you need it:** Without web search, your agent only knows what's in its training data (which has a knowledge cutoff). With it, the agent can look up current prices, news, documentation, and answers.

**Providers:**
- Brave Search API (free tier: 2,000 queries/month)
- SearXNG (self-hosted, unlimited, free)

### Browser Automation

Lets your agent visit websites, fill forms, click buttons, and extract content.

**Why you need it:** Some information isn't available via APIs. Browser automation lets the agent interact with websites like a human would.

**Implementation:** Typically uses Playwright or Puppeteer under the hood.

### Code Execution

Lets your agent write and run code to solve problems.

**Why you need it:** Math, data processing, file manipulation — some tasks are better solved by writing and executing code than by the LLM reasoning about them.

### File Management

Lets your agent read, write, and organize files on your machine.

**Why you need it:** Your agent can manage notes, generate reports, organize downloads, and maintain its own workspace files.

## The claude-mem Plugin

The most important plugin for most users. **claude-mem** gives your agent persistent semantic memory that works across sessions.

### What it does

- **Saves observations** — key facts, decisions, and context from conversations
- **Semantic search** — find relevant memories by meaning, not just keywords
- **Cross-session memory** — your agent remembers things from weeks ago
- **Project-scoped** — memories are organized by project for clean separation

### How it works

During conversations, the agent creates "observations" — small records of important facts:

```
Observation: "Jet decided to use Next.js 16 for AI Bazaar because of
RSC support and Turbo mode."
```

These get indexed and stored. In future sessions, when the agent encounters a related topic, it can search its memory:

```
search(query="tech stack decision for AI Bazaar")
→ Returns the observation about Next.js 16
```

### Installation

```bash
openclaw plugins install claude-mem
```

### Configuration in openclaw.json

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "memory": "claude-mem"
    },
    "entries": {
      "claude-mem": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "syncMemoryFile": true,
          "workerPort": 37777,
          "project": "openclaw"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Key settings

- `syncMemoryFile: true` — auto-syncs MEMORY.md at session start
- `workerPort: 37777` — the memory search service port
- `project` — namespace for memories (keeps different projects separate)

### Using memory in conversations

Your agent uses memory automatically, but you can also interact with it:

- **"Remember that..."** — tells the agent to save something specific
- **"What do you know about...?"** — triggers a memory search
- **"Forget that..."** — removes a specific memory

## Installing Plugins

### Using the CLI

```bash
# List installed plugins
openclaw plugins list

# Install a plugin
openclaw plugins install <plugin-name>

# Enable/disable
openclaw plugins enable <plugin-name>
openclaw plugins disable <plugin-name>
```

### Plugin structure

Plugins live in `~/.openclaw/extensions/`:

```
~/.openclaw/extensions/
└── claude-mem/
    ├── openclaw.plugin.json    # Plugin manifest
    ├── package.json            # Dependencies
    └── plugin/
        ├── skills/             # Skills provided by this plugin
        ├── modes/              # Language/style configurations
        ├── commands/           # Custom slash commands
        └── hooks/              # Event handlers
```

### Plugin manifest (openclaw.plugin.json)

```json
{
  "id": "claude-mem",
  "name": "Claude Memory",
  "description": "Persistent semantic memory with observation indexing",
  "version": "10.0.4",
  "type": "memory",
  "configSchema": {
    "syncMemoryFile": { "type": "boolean", "default": true },
    "workerPort": { "type": "number", "default": 37777 }
  }
}
```

## Building Your Own Skill

If you need a capability that doesn't exist as a pre-built skill, you can create your own.

### Basic structure

Create a directory with a manifest and implementation:

```
my-skill/
├── skill.json              # What tools this skill provides
└── index.ts                # Implementation
```

### Minimal example: Random Quote Skill

**skill.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "random-quote",
  "description": "Get a random inspirational quote",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "get_quote",
      "description": "Returns a random inspirational quote",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**index.ts:**
```typescript
const quotes = [
  "The best way to predict the future is to create it.",
  "Done is better than perfect.",
  "Move fast and fix things.",
];

export function get_quote() {
  const quote = quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)];
  return { quote };
}
```

### Testing your skill

Register it in your agent's config and test through a conversation:
- "Give me a random quote" → the agent uses your skill

## Recommended Setup for Beginners

Start with this minimal setup and add more as you need them:

1. **claude-mem plugin** — persistent memory (install first, most impactful)
2. **Web search skill** — current information access
3. **File management skill** — let the agent help organize things

Add these when you're ready:
4. Browser automation — for interacting with websites
5. Code execution — for data processing tasks
6. Custom skills — when you have specific needs

Don't install everything at once. Each skill adds to the agent's context (making it slower and more expensive). Add skills when you actually need them.
