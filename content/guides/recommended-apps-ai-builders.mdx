## The Stack

This is the complete toolkit for someone building projects with AI coding tools. Every app here is one we use daily or recommend to beginners. Organized by workflow stage.

---

## Code Editors

Where you write code. AI-native editors are a massive productivity boost.

### VS Code — The Free Standard
**Free** | [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

The editor most developers already use. Huge extension marketplace, great Git integration, works on every platform. If you're starting out and don't want to pay for anything, this is the default.

### Cursor — AI-Native Editor
**Free tier (2,000 completions/mo) | Pro $20/mo** | [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)

Built on VS Code but with AI deeply integrated — tab completions, inline editing, chat with your codebase. The most popular AI code editor right now. If you're going to pay for one tool, this is probably it.

### Windsurf — The Alternative
**Free tier available | Pro $15/mo** | [windsurf.com](https://windsurf.com)

Another AI-native editor (by Codeium). Similar to Cursor with a unique "Cascade" feature for multi-step edits. More generous free tier than Cursor. Good second option if Cursor's pricing doesn't work for you.

---

## Terminal

Where AI coding tools like Claude Code actually run.

### Default Terminal (macOS/Windows/Linux)
**Free** | Built-in

Every OS comes with a terminal. It works. Start here.

### iTerm2 (macOS only)
**Free** | [iterm2.com](https://iterm2.com)

The terminal upgrade for macOS. Split panes, search, hotkey window, better colors. Every Mac developer switches to this eventually.

### Warp — AI Terminal
**Free tier | Team $15/mo** | [warp.dev](https://warp.dev)

A terminal with AI built in — ask questions, get command suggestions, auto-complete complex commands. Modern UI with blocks (organized output). Worth trying if you're terminal-intimidated.

### Windows Terminal
**Free** | [microsoft.com](https://aka.ms/terminal)

The modern terminal for Windows. Tabs, panes, GPU-accelerated rendering. Use it with WSL for a Linux-like experience.

---

## API Testing

For testing the APIs and backends you build.

### Bruno
**Free and open source** | [usebruno.com](https://usebruno.com)

API client that stores requests as files (git-friendly). No account required, no cloud sync. The privacy-respecting alternative to Postman. Our recommendation for new projects.

### Postman
**Free tier** | [postman.com](https://postman.com)

The most popular API testing tool. Huge community, pre-built collections for popular APIs. Heavier than Bruno but has more features and integrations.

---

## Deployment

Getting your projects on the internet.

### Vercel
**Free tier (generous)** | [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

One-click deployment for Next.js, React, and static sites. Git push to deploy. The fastest way to go from code to public URL. Free tier includes custom domains, HTTPS, and edge functions.

### Railway
**Free tier ($5 credit/mo) | Pro $5/mo** | [railway.app](https://railway.app)

Deploy anything — Node.js, Python, Go, databases. Less opinionated than Vercel (not just for frontend). Great for backend services, bots, and full-stack apps.

### Fly.io
**Free tier | Pay-as-you-go** | [fly.io](https://fly.io)

Deploy Docker containers globally. More control than Vercel or Railway. Good for when you need specific infrastructure (Redis, custom networking, multi-region).

---

## Databases

Where your data lives.

### Turso
**Free tier (500 DBs, 9GB storage)** | [turso.tech](https://turso.tech)

SQLite at the edge. Incredibly generous free tier. Embedded database that scales — start with a file, graduate to multi-region. AI Bazaar runs on Turso. Our top recommendation for new projects.

### Supabase
**Free tier (500MB, 2 projects)** | [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

PostgreSQL database + auth + storage + real-time + edge functions. The open-source Firebase alternative. More features than Turso but more complex. Great if you need auth and real-time built in.

### PlanetScale
**Free tier (1 DB)** | [planetscale.com](https://planetscale.com)

Serverless MySQL with branching (like Git for your database). Strong for teams and production workloads. Less relevant for solo builders but worth knowing about.

---

## AI Assistants

For research, problem-solving, and rubber-ducking.

### Claude
**Free tier | Pro $20/mo** | [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)

Our top recommendation. Best at understanding context, following instructions, and writing code. Claude Code (the CLI) is the most powerful AI coding tool available.

### ChatGPT
**Free tier | Plus $20/mo** | [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com)

The most well-known AI assistant. Broader plugin ecosystem, image generation with DALL-E, web browsing. Good all-rounder if you want one AI for everything.

### Perplexity
**Free tier | Pro $20/mo** | [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai)

AI-powered search engine that cites its sources. Better than Google for research questions. Use it when you need current, verified information with references.

---

## Communication

Where developers hang out and build in public.

### Telegram
**Free** | [telegram.org](https://telegram.org)

The messaging platform of choice for crypto and AI communities. Easy bot API (great for first projects). OpenClaw's default communication channel.

### Discord
**Free** | [discord.com](https://discord.com)

Where most developer communities live. Every major framework, library, and tool has a Discord server. Join them for support, networking, and staying current.

---

## Notes and Project Management

Organizing your thoughts and tracking work.

### Obsidian
**Free (personal) | Sync $4/mo** | [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)

Markdown-based note-taking with local-first storage. Your notes are plain files — no lock-in. Great for developers because it works like code (files, folders, git-compatible).

### Notion
**Free (personal) | Plus $10/mo** | [notion.so](https://notion.so)

All-in-one workspace for docs, databases, wikis, and project boards. More structured than Obsidian. Good if you prefer visual organization over file-based.

### Linear
**Free tier | Standard $8/user/mo** | [linear.app](https://linear.app)

Project management designed for software teams. Fast, keyboard-driven, opinionated workflows. The best issue tracker if you're serious about shipping regularly.

---

## The Beginner Stack (Free)

If you're just starting out, this costs $0:

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Editor | VS Code (or Cursor free tier) |
| Terminal | Default terminal (or iTerm2 on Mac) |
| AI | Claude free tier |
| Deployment | Vercel free tier |
| Database | Turso free tier |
| Notes | Obsidian |
| Communication | Telegram + Discord |
| API Testing | Bruno |

This stack can build and deploy real projects. Upgrade individual pieces as you hit limits.

## The Pro Stack ($40-60/month)

When you're ready to level up:

| Need | Tool | Cost |
|------|------|------|
| Editor | Cursor Pro | $20/mo |
| AI | Claude Pro | $20/mo |
| Deployment | Vercel (still free) | $0 |
| Database | Turso (still free) | $0 |
| Notes | Obsidian | $0 |
| Search | Perplexity Pro | $20/mo |

$40-60/month for a professional-grade AI development setup. That's less than most people spend on streaming services.
