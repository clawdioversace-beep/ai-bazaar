## The 3 Models That Matter Right Now

You don't need to understand every AI model on the market. Three companies dominate AI coding tools, and each has a different personality:

**Claude (by Anthropic)** — The thoughtful coder. Excels at understanding large codebases, following complex instructions, and writing clean, well-structured code. Best for: full-stack development, refactoring, and anything that requires reading lots of existing code before making changes.

**GPT (by OpenAI)** — The versatile generalist. Huge ecosystem of plugins and integrations. Strong at quick prototyping and creative problem-solving. Best for: rapid iteration, working with APIs, and projects where you need broad knowledge across many domains.

**Gemini (by Google)** — The data-friendly option. Deep integration with Google's ecosystem (Firebase, GCP, Android). Strong context window for processing large files. Best for: mobile development, Google Cloud projects, and data-heavy applications.

All three are capable of writing production code. The differences matter less than you think — pick one and start building.

## Free Tiers Compared

Every platform offers a free tier. Here's what you actually get:

| Platform | Free Tier | What You Get | Catch |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Claude | claude.ai | ~30 messages/day with Sonnet model | Resets daily, no API access |
| ChatGPT | chatgpt.com | GPT-4o with limits | Rate-limited during peak hours |
| Gemini | gemini.google.com | Gemini Pro with limits | Tied to Google account |

**The honest truth:** Free tiers are enough to learn and experiment. You'll hit limits when you try to build something real. That's when you decide if this is worth $20/month to you.

## Paid Plans Breakdown

All three charge roughly the same for their consumer plans:

### Claude Pro — $20/month
- Access to Claude Opus (most capable) and Sonnet (fast)
- 5x more usage than free tier
- Priority access during high-traffic periods
- **Best for:** People who want the strongest coding model and do a lot of back-and-forth with AI

### ChatGPT Plus — $20/month
- GPT-4o and GPT-o1 (reasoning model)
- DALL-E image generation, browsing, plugins
- Higher rate limits
- **Best for:** People who want an all-in-one AI tool (not just coding)

### Gemini Advanced — $20/month
- Gemini Ultra model
- 1M token context window
- Deep Google Workspace integration
- **Best for:** People already in the Google ecosystem

### Pro/Team plans — $100-200/month
All three offer higher tiers with more usage, team features, and API credits. Wait until you've outgrown the $20 tier before considering these.

## AI Coding Tools (The Real Power)

Here's what most beginners miss: **chatting with an AI is not the same as using an AI coding tool.** The real power comes from tools that can read your codebase, understand your project structure, and write code in context.

### Claude Code (Terminal)
Anthropic's official CLI tool. Runs in your terminal, reads your entire project, and makes changes across multiple files. Feels like pair programming with someone who's read every line of your code.
- **Price:** Requires Claude Pro ($20/mo) or API credits
- **Best for:** Backend development, full-stack projects, refactoring

### Cursor (IDE)
AI-native code editor built on VS Code. Tab completion, inline editing, and chat — all inside your editor. The most popular AI coding tool right now.
- **Price:** Free tier (2000 completions/mo), Pro $20/mo
- **Best for:** Frontend development, daily coding, people who live in their editor

### GitHub Copilot (IDE Plugin)
GitHub's AI assistant that plugs into VS Code, JetBrains, and others. Great autocomplete, good at pattern recognition.
- **Price:** Free for students/OSS, Individual $10/mo, Business $19/mo
- **Best for:** Autocomplete-heavy workflows, enterprise teams

### Windsurf (IDE)
Another AI-native editor (by Codeium). Similar to Cursor with some unique features like Cascade (multi-step edits).
- **Price:** Free tier available, Pro $15/mo
- **Best for:** People who want a Cursor alternative with a generous free tier

## The Decision Tree

Not sure where to start? Follow this:

**What's your budget?**

- **$0/month** → Use Claude free tier for learning + Cursor free tier for coding. This gets you surprisingly far.
- **$20/month** → Get Claude Pro. Use Claude Code for serious projects and claude.ai for quick questions.
- **$40/month** → Claude Pro + Cursor Pro. This is the power combo most professional AI-assisted developers use.

**What are you building?**

- **Web apps** → Claude Code or Cursor. Both excel here.
- **Mobile apps** → Cursor (better for visual work) or Gemini (if using Flutter/Firebase).
- **Scripts and automation** → Claude Code. Terminal-native workflow is fastest for this.
- **AI agents and MCP servers** → Claude Code. It understands the MCP protocol natively.

**How technical are you?**

- **Never coded before** → Start with Cursor. The IDE interface is less intimidating than a terminal.
- **Some experience** → Claude Code if you're comfortable in the terminal, Cursor if you prefer an IDE.
- **Experienced developer** → Claude Code for complex projects, Cursor for daily coding. Use both.

## Our Pick for Beginners

**Start with Claude's free tier + Cursor's free tier.** Zero cost, maximum learning.

When you're ready to pay, **Claude Pro ($20/month)** gives you the most capable coding model available. Add Cursor Pro ($20/month) when you want AI in your editor full-time.

The most important thing is to stop comparing and start building. Every hour spent choosing between models is an hour you could've spent building your first project. Pick one, build something, and switch later if it doesn't fit.
