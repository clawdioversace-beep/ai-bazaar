## Why You Need the Terminal

Every powerful AI coding tool — Claude Code, MCP servers, agent frameworks, package managers — runs in the terminal. If you want to use AI to build real software, you need to be comfortable here.

Good news: you don't need to master the terminal. You need about 20 commands to be productive. This guide covers all of them.

---

## Opening Your Terminal

### macOS
- Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", hit Enter
- **Better option:** Download [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) — it's free and much nicer

### Windows
- Press `Win + X`, select "Windows Terminal"
- **Or:** Search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu
- **For AI tools:** Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) — many tools expect a Linux-like environment

### Linux
- Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` on most distributions
- Or find "Terminal" in your applications menu

## Navigating the Filesystem

Think of your filesystem as nested folders. The terminal just lets you move between them with text commands instead of clicking.

### Where am I?

```bash
pwd
```

**P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory. Shows your current location. You'll see something like `/Users/yourname` or `/home/yourname`.

### What's in this folder?

```bash
ls
```

Lists everything in the current directory. Add flags for more detail:

```bash
ls -la    # Show hidden files + file sizes + permissions
ls -lt    # Sort by most recently modified
```

### Moving between folders

```bash
cd Documents          # Go into the Documents folder
cd ..                 # Go up one level
cd ~                  # Go to your home directory
cd /                  # Go to the root of the filesystem
cd ~/projects/my-app  # Go directly to a specific path
```

**Pro tip:** Press `Tab` to autocomplete folder names. Type `cd Doc` then press Tab — the terminal will complete it to `cd Documents/`.

### Creating folders and files

```bash
mkdir my-project              # Create a folder
mkdir -p projects/my-app/src  # Create nested folders in one go
touch index.ts                # Create an empty file
```

### Deleting things

```bash
rm file.txt           # Delete a file
rm -r my-folder       # Delete a folder and everything in it
```

**Warning:** There's no recycle bin in the terminal. `rm` is permanent. Double-check before you delete.

## Finding Files

### By name

```bash
find . -name "*.ts"              # Find all TypeScript files
find . -name "package.json"      # Find a specific file
```

The `.` means "start searching from the current directory."

### By content

```bash
grep -r "API_KEY" .              # Search for text inside files
grep -r "function login" src/    # Search in a specific folder
```

`-r` means recursive (search inside subfolders too).

---

## Reading and Editing Files

### Quick file preview

```bash
cat README.md         # Print entire file contents
head -20 README.md    # Show first 20 lines
tail -20 server.log   # Show last 20 lines
```

### Editing files

For quick edits, use `nano` (comes pre-installed):

```bash
nano .env             # Open file in a simple editor
```

In nano: `Ctrl + O` to save, `Ctrl + X` to exit.

For real coding, use a proper editor like VS Code or Cursor:

```bash
code .                # Open current folder in VS Code
cursor .              # Open current folder in Cursor
```

## Git in 5 Commands

Git tracks changes to your code. Every AI coding project uses it. You need these 5 commands:

### 1. Clone a project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

Downloads a project from GitHub to your computer.

### 2. Check what changed

```bash
git status
```

Shows which files you've modified, added, or deleted.

### 3. Stage your changes

```bash
git add .                    # Stage all changes
git add src/index.ts         # Stage a specific file
```

Staging means "mark these changes to be saved."

### 4. Save your changes (commit)

```bash
git commit -m "Add login page"
```

Creates a snapshot of your staged changes with a descriptive message.

### 5. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push
```

Uploads your commits to the remote repository (GitHub).

**The full workflow:**

```bash
git status                    # See what changed
git add .                     # Stage everything
git commit -m "Your message"  # Save snapshot
git push                      # Upload to GitHub
```

That's it. You can learn branching, merging, and rebasing later when you need them.

## Package Managers

Package managers install libraries (other people's code) that your project uses.

### npm (Node.js)
The default for JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

```bash
npm install              # Install all dependencies from package.json
npm install express      # Add a new package
npm run dev              # Run a script defined in package.json
```

### Bun
A faster alternative to npm. Same commands, faster execution.

```bash
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun add express          # Add a new package
bun run dev              # Run a script
```

### pip (Python)
For Python projects.

```bash
pip install requests     # Install a package
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install all dependencies
```

**How to know which one to use:** Look at the project files.
- Has `package.json` + `bun.lock`? → Use `bun`
- Has `package.json` + `package-lock.json`? → Use `npm`
- Has `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`? → Use `pip`

## Environment Variables and .env Files

Environment variables store configuration values that change between environments (your machine vs production). They're also where API keys live.

### The .env file

Most projects use a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
API_KEY=sk-abc123def456
PORT=3000
```

Your code reads these values at runtime. In Node.js:

```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

### Important rules

1. **Never commit `.env` to git** — it contains secrets
2. **Do commit `.env.example`** — shows what variables are needed (without real values)
3. **Bun loads `.env` automatically** — no extra setup needed
4. **Node.js needs `dotenv`** — or use the `--env-file` flag

### Creating a .env file from an example

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # Copy the template
nano .env                # Edit and add your real values
```

## Common Gotchas and Fixes

### "command not found"

The program isn't installed, or your terminal doesn't know where to find it.

```bash
# Check if it's installed
which node      # Shows path if installed, nothing if not

# Common fixes:
# 1. Install it (e.g., brew install node on macOS)
# 2. Restart your terminal (close and reopen)
# 3. Source your profile: source ~/.zshrc (macOS) or source ~/.bashrc (Linux)
```

### "permission denied"

You're trying to do something that requires admin access.

```bash
sudo npm install -g typescript   # Run with admin privileges
```

Use `sudo` sparingly. If everything needs `sudo`, something is misconfigured.

### "EACCES" errors with npm

npm is trying to write to a directory you don't own. Fix:

```bash
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
# Add to your shell profile: export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

Or just use Bun — it doesn't have this problem.

### "port already in use"

Another process is using the same port.

```bash
# Find what's using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill it
kill -9 <PID>     # Replace <PID> with the process ID from above
```
