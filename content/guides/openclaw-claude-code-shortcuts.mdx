## CLAUDE.md Power Tips

CLAUDE.md files are how you configure Claude Code's behavior for your project. They work at two levels:

### User-level (global)

`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` applies to every project you open in Claude Code. Put your preferences here:

```markdown
# Global Preferences
- Default to Bun instead of npm
- Keep responses concise
- Always use TypeScript
```

### Project-level

`./CLAUDE.md` in your project root applies only to that project:

```markdown
# Project: My App
- Use Tailwind for styling
- Database: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- Run tests with: bun test
```

### Hierarchy

Project-level CLAUDE.md overrides user-level for that project. Claude Code reads both and merges them.

### The .claude/ directory

Your `~/.claude/` directory contains:

```
~/.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Global instructions
├── settings.json          # Permissions and plugin config
├── settings.local.json    # Local overrides (not synced)
├── commands/              # Custom slash commands
├── scripts/               # Utility scripts
├── hooks/                 # Event hooks (status line, etc.)
└── plugins/               # Installed plugins
```

## Combining OpenClaw + Claude Code

The power combo: use Claude Code as your coding assistant and OpenClaw as your autonomous agent.

### The workflow

1. **Claude Code** handles coding tasks — reading your codebase, writing code, running tests, deploying
2. **OpenClaw** handles autonomous tasks — monitoring, alerting, research, scheduled jobs
3. **Both** can communicate via Telegram — Claude Code sends updates, OpenClaw handles async tasks

### Example setup

```
Claude Code (terminal)
  └── Your CTO — reads code, builds features, commits
  └── Uses: /gsd:quick, /gsd:execute-phase, /review

OpenClaw (background)
  └── Your assistant — monitors, researches, alerts
  └── Uses: Telegram, cron jobs, memory, web search
```

### Communication between them

Claude Code can send messages to your Telegram (where OpenClaw also lives):

```bash
# From Claude Code, notify via Telegram
~/.claude/scripts/telegram-notify.sh --update "Feature X is done"
```

And OpenClaw can be configured to watch for specific events and react.

### When to use which

| Task | Use |
|------|-----|
| Write code | Claude Code |
| Refactor a file | Claude Code |
| Run tests | Claude Code |
| Research a topic | OpenClaw |
| Monitor prices | OpenClaw |
| Scheduled reminders | OpenClaw |
| Deploy an app | Claude Code |
| Daily briefing | OpenClaw |

The key insight: Claude Code is a session-based tool (you start it, work, stop it). OpenClaw is always-on (daemon/gateway running in the background). Use each for what it's designed for.
