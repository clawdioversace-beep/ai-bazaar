## Why "First Wins" Matter

The goal of your first project isn't to build the next unicorn. It's to prove to yourself that you can make a computer do something useful with AI help. That confidence compounds — each project teaches you patterns you'll reuse forever.

These 5 projects are ordered from easiest to most ambitious. Each one teaches a fundamental skill.

---

## Project 1: Personal Portfolio Site

**Time:** 30-60 minutes | **Teaches:** HTML/CSS, deployment, working with AI tools

A single-page site that says who you are and what you're building. It's the most common first project for a reason — you end up with something real you can show people.

### What you'll build
- A responsive single-page site with your name, bio, and links
- Deployed to a public URL anyone can visit

### How to build it

1. Open your AI coding tool (Cursor or Claude Code)
2. Tell it: *"Create a personal portfolio site with my name, a short bio section, a projects section with 3 placeholder cards, and a contact section with links to my GitHub and Twitter. Use plain HTML and Tailwind CSS via CDN. Make it dark-themed and responsive."*
3. The AI will generate the entire site
4. Preview it locally, tweak the content
5. Deploy to Vercel:

```bash
npm install -g vercel    # Install Vercel CLI
vercel                   # Deploy (follow the prompts)
```

### What you'll learn
- How to prompt AI for code generation
- How to iterate on AI output ("make the header sticky", "change the color scheme")
- How deployment works (local → internet)

## Project 2: Telegram Bot

**Time:** 1-2 hours | **Teaches:** APIs, bot tokens, environment variables, server processes

A Telegram bot that responds to commands. This is foundational — bots are one of the most common things you'll build with AI.

### What you'll build
- A bot that responds to `/start`, `/help`, and a custom command
- Runs on your machine (or a server)

### How to build it

1. **Create a bot:** Open Telegram, search for `@BotFather`, send `/newbot`, follow the prompts. You'll get a token like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`.

2. **Set up your project:**

```bash
mkdir my-telegram-bot && cd my-telegram-bot
bun init -y
bun add grammy
```

3. **Tell your AI tool:** *"Create a Telegram bot using grammy that responds to /start with a welcome message, /help with a list of commands, and /quote with a random motivational quote. Use the bot token from a BOT_TOKEN environment variable."*

4. **Create your `.env`:**

```bash
BOT_TOKEN=your-token-from-botfather
```

5. **Run it:**

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

6. Open Telegram, find your bot, send `/start`.

### What you'll learn
- How API tokens work
- Environment variables in practice
- Long-running processes (the bot stays alive listening for messages)
- The request/response pattern of APIs

## Project 3: Crypto Price Alert Script

**Time:** 1-2 hours | **Teaches:** REST APIs, JSON parsing, scheduling, conditional logic

A script that checks cryptocurrency prices and alerts you when they cross a threshold. This is a great introduction to working with external APIs.

### What you'll build
- A script that fetches live prices from CoinGecko's free API
- Sends you a Telegram message when a price crosses your target
- Runs on a schedule (every 5 minutes)

### How to build it

1. **Set up:**

```bash
mkdir price-alerts && cd price-alerts
bun init -y
```

2. **Tell your AI tool:** *"Create a price alert script that: (1) fetches Bitcoin and Ethereum prices from the CoinGecko API (free, no key needed), (2) compares against configurable price targets, (3) sends a Telegram message via bot API when a target is crossed. Store targets in a JSON config file. Use Bun with fetch API."*

3. **The CoinGecko API is free and needs no key:**

```
https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin,ethereum&vs_currencies=usd
```

4. **Run on a schedule** using a simple loop or cron:

```bash
# Run every 5 minutes with cron
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/price-alerts && bun run index.ts
```

### What you'll learn
- Making HTTP requests to external APIs
- Parsing JSON responses
- Working with scheduled tasks (cron)
- Combining multiple APIs (CoinGecko + Telegram)

## Project 4: MCP Server for Your Notes

**Time:** 2-3 hours | **Teaches:** MCP protocol, tool definitions, AI tool integration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is how AI tools discover and use external capabilities. Building a simple MCP server teaches you the protocol that powers AI agent ecosystems.

### What you'll build
- An MCP server that lets Claude Code search and read your markdown notes
- Two tools: `search_notes` and `read_note`

### How to build it

1. **Set up:**

```bash
mkdir my-notes-mcp && cd my-notes-mcp
bun init -y
bun add @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod
```

2. **Tell your AI tool:** *"Create an MCP server using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk that exposes two tools: (1) search_notes — takes a query string and returns matching filenames from a ~/notes/ directory by searching file contents, (2) read_note — takes a filename and returns the full contents. Use stdio transport. Make it work with markdown files."*

3. **Create some test notes:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/notes
echo "# Meeting Notes\nDiscussed the new API design" > ~/notes/meeting-2026-02-25.md
echo "# Ideas\nBuild a price alert bot" > ~/notes/ideas.md
```

4. **Register with Claude Code** by adding to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-notes": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/my-notes-mcp/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. Now in Claude Code, you can say "search my notes for API design" and it'll use your MCP server.

### What you'll learn
- The MCP protocol (how AI tools talk to external services)
- Tool definitions (input schemas, descriptions)
- How Claude Code discovers and uses tools
- Server-side TypeScript

## Project 5: AI Content Summarizer

**Time:** 2-3 hours | **Teaches:** LLM API calls, prompt engineering, chaining operations

A command-line tool that takes a URL, fetches the page content, and produces a summary using an AI model. This teaches you the most fundamental pattern in AI engineering: fetch → process → generate.

### What you'll build
- A CLI script that accepts a URL
- Fetches and extracts the main content
- Sends it to an LLM API with a summarization prompt
- Outputs a clean, structured summary

### How to build it

1. **Set up:**

```bash
mkdir summarizer && cd summarizer
bun init -y
bun add @anthropic-ai/sdk
```

2. **Tell your AI tool:** *"Create a CLI script that: (1) takes a URL as a command-line argument, (2) fetches the page HTML, (3) extracts the main text content (strip tags, scripts, styles), (4) sends the text to Claude API with a prompt asking for a structured summary with key points, (5) outputs the summary to stdout. Use the Anthropic SDK. Read API key from ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var."*

3. **Set up your API key:**

```bash
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > .env
```

4. **Run it:**

```bash
bun run summarize.ts https://example.com/interesting-article
```

### What you'll learn
- Making LLM API calls programmatically
- Prompt engineering (structuring instructions for the AI)
- Chaining operations (fetch → process → generate)
- Building useful CLI tools

## What to Build Next

After these 5 projects, you've learned the fundamental patterns:

- **Project 1** → UI generation and deployment
- **Project 2** → APIs and bots
- **Project 3** → External data and scheduling
- **Project 4** → The MCP protocol
- **Project 5** → LLM API integration

Now look at your own life for problems to solve. The best projects come from personal pain points:

- **Annoyed by repetitive tasks?** → Automate them with a script or bot
- **Want to track something?** → Build a dashboard or alert system
- **Sharing knowledge?** → Build a tool that helps others learn
- **Into DeFi?** → Build a portfolio tracker or trade analyzer

The jump from "tutorial project" to "real project" is smaller than you think. You already have the patterns — now apply them to problems you actually care about.
