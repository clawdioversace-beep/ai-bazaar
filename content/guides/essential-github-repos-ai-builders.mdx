## Why This List

There are thousands of AI repos on GitHub. Most are demos, abandoned experiments, or forks of forks. This list is the 20 we actually use and recommend — repos that are actively maintained, well-documented, and solve real problems.

Organized by what you're building.

## MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers let AI tools interact with external systems. These are the ones worth installing.

### 1. GitHub MCP Server
**[modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)**

The official collection of MCP servers from Anthropic. Includes servers for GitHub, filesystem, PostgreSQL, Slack, Google Drive, and more. Start here — it's the reference implementation.

### 2. Awesome MCP Servers
**[punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers)**

Community-curated list of every MCP server worth knowing about. Organized by category (databases, APIs, DevOps, AI). Use this to find servers for specific integrations.

### 3. Playwright MCP
**[anthropics/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/anthropics/playwright-mcp)**

Browser automation as an MCP server. Let your AI agent navigate websites, fill forms, take screenshots, and extract data. Essential for scraping and testing workflows.

### 4. Brave Search MCP
**[anthropics/brave-search-mcp](https://github.com/anthropics/brave-search-mcp)**

Web search capability for AI agents via Brave Search API. Free tier (2,000 searches/month) is enough for personal agent use. Better privacy than Google alternatives.

### 5. Context7
**[upstash/context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)**

Library documentation lookup as an MCP tool. Instead of your AI hallucinating API details, Context7 fetches real, up-to-date documentation. Dramatically reduces coding errors.

---

## Agent Frameworks

Tools for building multi-step, autonomous AI agents.

### 6. LangGraph
**[langchain-ai/langgraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)**

Build stateful, multi-step AI agents as graphs. Each node is an LLM call or action, edges define the flow. The most popular framework for complex agent workflows. Python-first.

### 7. CrewAI
**[crewAIInc/crewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)**

Multi-agent orchestration where agents have roles, goals, and backstories. Great for simulating teams — a "researcher" agent feeds a "writer" agent feeds a "reviewer" agent. Python.

### 8. AutoGen
**[microsoft/autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)**

Microsoft's multi-agent conversation framework. Agents talk to each other to solve problems. Strong at complex reasoning tasks where one model's output feeds another's input.

### 9. GPT Researcher
**[assafelovic/gpt-researcher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher)**

Autonomous research agent that plans searches, gathers sources, evaluates credibility, and writes comprehensive reports with citations. Impressive out-of-the-box for deep research tasks.

### 10. Vercel AI SDK
**[vercel/ai](https://github.com/vercel/ai)**

The best TypeScript SDK for building AI-powered apps. Unified interface for Claude, GPT, Gemini, and open-source models. Streaming, tool use, structured output — all handled cleanly.

## Learning Resources

Repos designed to teach, not just to use.

### 11. MCP for Beginners (Microsoft)
**[microsoft/mcp-for-beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-for-beginners)**

Microsoft's step-by-step guide to the Model Context Protocol. 25 lessons covering everything from "what is MCP?" to building production servers. The best free MCP course available.

### 12. WTF Solidity
**[AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity)**

Learn Solidity (Ethereum smart contract language) through 50+ practical lessons. Each lesson is a self-contained concept with code examples. The most accessible Solidity tutorial.

### 13. Chainlink Full Blockchain Solidity Course
**[smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js)**

Patrick Collins' legendary free course covering Solidity from zero to production. 32+ hours of content with hands-on projects. The gold standard for blockchain development education.

### 14. Build Your Own X
**[codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)**

Not AI-specific, but essential. Tutorials for building databases, compilers, Docker, Git, and more from scratch. Understanding how tools work under the hood makes you a better AI-assisted coder.

---

## Developer Tools

Repos that improve your day-to-day development workflow.

### 15. Cursor Rules
**[pontusab/cursor.directory](https://github.com/pontusab/cursor.directory)**

Community-maintained collection of `.cursorrules` files — instructions that configure how Cursor AI behaves for specific frameworks (Next.js, Python, Rust, etc.). Copy the right rules for your stack and Cursor becomes dramatically more useful.

### 16. Awesome Claude Code
**[anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)**

Official Claude Code repository with documentation, examples, and community contributions. Bookmark this for the latest features, MCP integrations, and best practices.

### 17. Shadcn UI
**[shadcn-ui/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui)**

Not an AI tool, but the most AI-friendly UI component library. Copy-paste components (not a dependency). Claude Code and Cursor generate excellent shadcn/ui code because it's in their training data.

---

## Web3 + AI

Repos at the intersection of AI agents and blockchain.

### 18. Solana Agent Kit
**[sendaifun/solana-agent-kit](https://github.com/sendaifun/solana-agent-kit)**

AI agent toolkit for Solana — wallet management, token swaps, NFT operations, and DeFi interactions. The reference implementation for building AI agents that interact with Solana.

### 19. DeFi Hack Labs
**[SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs)**

Security-focused repo that reproduces real DeFi exploits. Not just for security researchers — understanding how hacks work makes you build more secure smart contracts. Essential before deploying anything with real money.

### 20. Eliza
**[elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)**

Multi-agent simulation framework with built-in support for crypto trading, social media, and autonomous decision-making. Popular for building AI agents that operate in the crypto ecosystem.

## How to Use This List

Don't try to learn all 20 at once. Pick based on what you're building:

**Building an AI coding tool?** → Start with #1, #5, #10, #11
**Building AI agents?** → Start with #6, #7, #9, #11
**Building in Web3/DeFi?** → Start with #12, #13, #18, #19
**Just getting started?** → Star them all, then start with #11, #14, #15

**Pro tip:** Use GitHub's "Star" feature as a bookmark. Star repos now, explore them when you need them. Stars also help the maintainers — it signals that their work matters.

> Want a curated toolkit instead of individual repos? Check out our [Starter Packs](/packs) — pre-assembled collections of tools for specific use cases.
